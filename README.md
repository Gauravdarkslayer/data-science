# COVID-19 Dashboard

A project built by Team-DSC07 as part of [The Uplift Project](https://upliftproject.tech/#/). 

## Installation

In the wake of the current global pandemic, it becomes vital for us to have accurate data, in order to make informed decisions and take precautionary measures.

The dashboard helps you track and analyse state-wise/country-wise confirmed cases and deaths caused by COVID-19.

So each participant will create their own dashboard - they'll collect data individually and build unique visualisations for further analysis.
